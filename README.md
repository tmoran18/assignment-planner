<h1 align="center">Assignment Planner App - Created with NextJS</h1>

<p align="center">This is my favorite project to date. I absolutely love using NextJS. I built this app and use it in my day to day life. I would previously construct my assignment planner in word which would take me 30+ minutes typing all the dates out. I can now construct my planner in minutes.</p>
